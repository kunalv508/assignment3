An Example of a Closure

Two one sentence summaries:

    a closure is one way of supporting first-class functions; it is an expression 
    that can reference variables within its scope (when it was first declared), 
    be assigned to a variable, be passed as an argument to a function, or be 
    returned as a function result. 
    
    Or a closure is a stack frame which is allocated when a function starts its 
    execution, and not freed after the function returns (as if a 'stack frame' 
    were allocated on the heap rather than the stack!).

The following code returns a reference to a function:


function sayHello2(name) {
  var text = 'Hello ' + name; // Local variable
  var say = function() { console.log(text); }
  return say;
}
var say2 = sayHello2('Bob');
say2(); // logs "Hello Bob"
